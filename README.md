# bootcamp-portfolio-project
A Real Estate Website project for my bootcamp portfolio project

First of all, I use the same bootstrap installation versions as the Nucamp website used in week 1:
"devDependencies": {
    "lite-server": "^2.3.0"
  },
  "dependencies": {
    "bootstrap": "^4.0.0",
    "font-awesome": "^4.7.0",
    "jquery": "^3.3.1",
    "popper.js": "^1.12.9"
  }
}
